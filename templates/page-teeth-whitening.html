                    <h2>Does teeth whitening hurt?</h2>
                    <p>Teeth whitening does not hurt for most people. At Floss, Deep Teeth Whitening is often performed
                        for people who have sensitive teeth and cannot wear trays for home whitening. Some, but not all
                        patients, will experience sensitivity after whitening. Usually this will only occur towards the
                        end of your whitening session when the benefits have been achieved. Some people may experience
                        sensitivity in the hours after whitening, and using Sensodyne ® toothpaste on your teeth and avoiding hot and cold foods can help
                        alleviate this. Most people do not need any painkillers for this but if you are anxious at all
                        about the procedure, you may consider taking some gentle painkillers before your appointment.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How long will the teeth whitening results last?</h2>
                    <p>This depends on any habits you may have such as smoking, drinking red wine or eating staining
                        foods. The less of these you consume, the longer the effects will last. Generally, you can
                        expect 1-3 years. If you do smoke, we would recommend getting home whitening trays for top-ups
                        when needed. Regular hygiene appointments can also help maintain your brightness.</p>

                        <h2>How long does Teeth Whitening take?</h2>
                    <p>The complete teeth whitening procedure takes just 90 minutes. The teeth whitening begins with
                        a preparation period followed by 45 minutes of whitening. This is done in 3 sessions of 15
                        minutes. A hygiene appointment is recommended prior to the actual Teeth Whitening session if
                        you have any tartar or staining on your teeth they may not whiten as well as otherwise
                        possible.</p>

                    <h2>What can I eat right after my treatment?</h2>
                    <p>For the first 48 hours after whitening, your teeth are more porous and susceptible to staining so we recommend avoiding dark-colored foods and beverages. The rule of thumb is: rule of thumb: If it would stain a white shirt, it will likely stain your teeth!</p>
                    <p>We recommend eating plain foods, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lean proteins: Chicken, white fish</li>
                            <li>Dairy: Plain yogurt, cottage cheese, milk</li>
                            <li>Fruit & veg: Cauliflower, potatoes (without skin), peeled apples</li>
                            <li>Carbohydrates: White rice, pasta, white bread</li>
                        </ul></p>
                    <p>Finally, be sure to stay hydrated as drinking plenty of water throughout the day helps wash away potential stain-causing particles. Rinse with water after eating or drinking anything that could cause discoloration.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How should I maintain my bright smile?</h2>
                    <p>Maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial to maintaining whitened teeth! Ensure you: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brush your teeth at least twice a day, but ideally after every meal. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to brush gently to avoid damaging enamel.</li>
                            <li>Use a whitening-friendly toothpaste containing fluoride to help preserve the results and strengthen enamel.</li>
                            <li>Floss daily to remove plaque and prevent discoloration between teeth.</li>
                            <li>Rinse with alcohol-free mouthwash to kill bacteria without drying out your mouth, making teeth more vulnerable to stains.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <h2>How dramatic will my results be?</h2>
                    <p>There is a limit to how white your teeth will naturally go. Floss' Deep Teeth Whitening will get
                        your teeth as white as they can. Usually, your teeth can lighten by nine to twelve shades in one 90-minute session. This level of whiteness will vary
                        from person to person.</p>

                        <h2>Is teeth whitening safe?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, completely. Extensive research and clinical studies indicate that whitening teeth is safe.
                        In fact, many dentists consider teeth whitening the safest cosmetic dental procedure available.
                        As with any teeth whitening product, Teeth Whitening is not usually performed on anyone under 18
                        years of age, and is not recommended for pregnant or lactating women. In certain circumstances
                        teeth whitening can be performed on children over the age of 13 for discoloured teeth. Your
                        dentist will decide if whitening is needed.</p>

                        

                        <h2>How does the Deep Teeth Whitening System at Floss work?</h2>
                    <p>The light-activated teeth whitening gel’s active ingredient is Hydrogen Peroxide. As the Hydrogen
                        Peroxide gel is broken down, oxygen enters the enamel and dentin, bleaching coloured substances
                        while the structure of the teeth is unchanged. The Teeth Whitening light aids in activating the
                        hydrogen peroxide and helps it penetrate the surface of the teeth.</p>

                        <h2>Are there any side effects to Teeth Whitening?</h2>
                    <p>The only side effect that some people experience is temporary increased teeth sensitivity to
                        cold. These symptoms disappear within 1-3 days after completion of the teeth whitening
                        treatment.</p>

                        <h2>Can teeth whitening really boost my confidence?</h2>
                    <p>Yes — a brighter smile can make a real difference: people often notice stronger first impressions at work, more ease in social situations, greater willingness to appear in photos and on social media, and even better results in dating. After a successful whitening many clients leave standing taller, speaking with more assurance and smiling freely — a change that’s not just vanity but a genuine feeling of comfort in their own skin. At Emerald Dental we see this translate into real social gains: people become more outgoing, join events more readily, and stop letting their smile hold them back.</p>

                    <h2>Who may benefit from Floss's Deep Teeth Whitening?</h2>
                    <p>Almost everyone sees the immediate effects of a treatment. However, teeth whitening may be more
                        effective on some that it is on others. We can determine if you are a viable candidate for Teeth
                        Whitening through a thorough quick exam, including a teeth shade
                        assessment.</p>

                    <h2>Is there any difference between over-the-counter teeth whiteners and Floss's Deep Teeth
                        Whitening?</h2>
                    <p>Yes. Consulting your dental professional is always the first step to whitening your teeth safely.
                        Plus, over-the-counter teeth whitening strips, brush-on gels and toothpastes take weeks or
                        months to whiten your teeth just a few shades. In-clinic whitening is clinically proven to
                        whiten your teeth nine to twelve shades in just 1 session.</p>

                    <h2>How does tray whitening compare?</h2>
                    <p>Tray whitening is a great and inexpensive way to whiten your teeth. It is often combined with
                        Floss' Deep Teeth Whitening so you can achieve instant results and you will still have the
                        whitening trays to use later to “top up” your teeth safely and effectively if you feel they
                        have stained after time or after foods which are particularly strong in colour.</p>

                    <h2>Can I just get a tray system over the counter?</h2>
                    <p>You cannot buy teeth whitening gels of the same strength and quality from a pharmacy as you can
                    from your dentist. Moreover, the tray made by your dentist is custom-made and fits your teeth
                    like a personal retainer. A tray you make yourself from a kit may leak gel into your mouth and
                    allow saliva into the gel reducing its effectiveness and can even damage your gums.</p>
